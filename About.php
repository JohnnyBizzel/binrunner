        <p style="color:darkslategray;">The app (Bin Runner) allows you to get your rubbish taken out as a service by someone in your local community.</p>
        
        <p style="color:darkslategray;">Definition?</p><br> 
        
        <p style="color:darkslategray;">Bin Runner: A person within your community or close by who will put your rubbish bin out for collection.

Client: The person who wants their bin put out.</p>
        
            <p style="color:darkslategray;">A registration is free for both the BinRunner and the Client. The Client will need to pay a small fee each time their bin has been emptied. No cost will incurred for an incomplete request.</p><br>
        
        <p style="color:darkslategray;">Location verification will be required by both the Bin Runner and the client to ensure the job is complete. Therefore it is important you have your location enable on your settings for this app. How does it work:</p>
        
        <p style="color:darkslategray;">The BinRunner and client will register, this will allow us to know your location
When a client makes a request, a notification will be sent to the Bin Runners within your area
When the Bin Runner marks the job complete on the app
The client will mark the bin as emptied an automatic transfer will occur
Bin return once emptied is also available for an additional cost

        <p style="color:darkslategray;">The BinRunner must complete the task if they accept the request within 8hrs of the service. Failure to do so will result in automatic removal from this service.  8hrs is required for others to except the job.</p>
